#loops in python
#two loops (for and while) loop
#for loop can iterate for sequence of iterable objects in python like
# (strings,lists,dictionary,etc)
#example iterating over a string
#for i in name:
  #  print(i,end=",")
   # print(i) #or
# example:iterating over a list
'''colors=["red","blue","green","black"]
for color in colors:
    print(color)
    for i in color:
        print(i)'''

#for k in range(5):
#    print(k+1)
#here k+1= ki is 0+1 so the output will start from 1 to the hihgestmentioned range
#   print(k)
#here k will produce output starting from 0for k in range(5)
#for k in range(1,9):
    #for (1,9) range goes 1 to n and output is n-1
 #   print(k)


'''for k in range(1, 12, 3):
  print(k)'''
  #here the range in output starts from 1 and goes till 12 and skips 3 numbers from 1 to 12, so the output is (1,4,7,10)
